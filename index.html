							<p>
								I got my start at UC Santa Cruz in 2009 working on my BS in Bioengineering with a focus on 
								developing Assistive Technology to help disadvantaged communities and further universal access
								in technology. I started working with <a href="https://users.soe.ucsc.edu/~srikur/index.html">Dr. 
								Sri Kurniawan</a> and <a href="https://danserlab.github.io/index.html">Dr. Mircea Teodorescu</a> 
								on developing a robot that would be able to help older people safely stay in their homes for longer
								by using camera vision and machine learning to do wellness checks and distanced heart rate analysis. This 
								initial interest in	research encouraged me to return to UCSC for graduate school in 2014. 
							</p>
							<p>
								I continued working with Professor Kurniawan interviewing physical therapist and stroke 
								reahablitation experts in an attempt to develop technology for rapid recovery of motor skills 
								after stroke, but shifted my focus as the new department of Computational	Media formed around 
								me and an influx of new professors led me to collaborate with 
								<a href="http://katherineinterface.com/">Dr. Katherine Isbister</a>.
							</p>
							<p>
								Her focus on Research through Design and tactile fidgeting objects helped form my next project. 
								I worked with Makers, designers and explored smart material like e-textiles, sensors and 
								microcontrollers to create deformable controllers for emotion detection and regulation in children (Worry Pet)
								and ADHD regulation (Fidget Ball). My work process is holistic from idea formation to execution to user testing 
								and refinement it always takes many iterations to get to the "end" product. All of my product stages
								involved an interdisciplinary team and I love to make new connections with entusastic developers.
							</p>

							capturing computer mice">
							<p>
								As a less formal application of my experience and a way to explore new spaces I organized a  workshop 
								with the Games and Playable Media department on developing deformable controllers. Over an 8 hour period 
								participants developed their own alterative controllers interfaces and games to play with them. 
								Example shown to the right.

							<p>	
								Throughout the life of my projects I worked as the programmer, hardware developer, project manager 
								and user testing lead on the various projects I developed. As both of my research 
								projects were research platforms for interaction data collection, they both created very data rich logs. 
								I helped facilitate and document consistant procedures for data collection, annotated the logs with 
								interview transcripts and helped initial interpretation so that the machine learning team was able 
								to parse through the data for model training.

							<p>
								I've been pleased to work with exterior collaborators and as a result the emotional regulation
								device developed into a commercial product which was featured in Time Magizine's Best Inventions of 2021,
								<a href="https://time.com/collection/best-inventions-2021/6113137/purrble/">the Sproutel Purrble</a>. My other
								project the Fidget Ball was used as the foundation of an NIH R21 grant studying attention attinuation, 
								which is ongoing at UC Davis. I finished my Ph.D. in the summer of 2021 and I'm in the process of making the 
								transision to industry with a focus on UX Research.

								The COVID lockdown was both productive in that I had plenty of time to round out my dissertation with less distractions 
								however it also meant that user studies came to a more abrupt end than anticipated. As the team came out of lockdown the
								NSF grant backed medical study was fufilled by the UC Davis team and helped verify some of the preliminary findings that
								were reflected in my dissertation and the project is still in active refinement by Nahid Nasiri, Katherine Isbister and
								the Machine Learning and Medical Research teams. Further exploration was presented at CHI 2024 in the article
								<a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3613905.3650856">"Extracting the Affective Content of Fidgeting in Adults with 
									ADHD via Machine Learning and a Hand-held Soft Tangible Device" </a>.

							<p>
								I have continued to hone my phsyical prototyping and electrical engineering skills while working at Palace Games helping
								to develop and build their pop-up immersive mini-golf experience called Lolliland. I helped to embed eletronics into the set
								design, interactive elements and kept the lights from dimming too often. It's been extreamly gratifing exploring user
								interaction and experience design in the wild in a fast paced always improving expereience.

								Outside of research I love spending time with dogs and spent a lot of my spare time during grad school working
								with <a href="http://www.wearewoofpack.com/">WoofPack831</a>, a pack walking group that
								helps train dogs in well-mannered interactions with other dogs. This love of dogs led to an intership with 
								<a href="https://joincompanion.com/">Companion Labs</a> in 2020 right at the beginning of the pandemic 
								helping user testing and fund raise for their ML backed training device to help keep dogs entertained 
								and trained while stuck at home.

								I grew up moving internationally so I'm very much a third culture kid but the Bay Area has definetly felt like
								home for the last decade, so when I finished my degree in 2021, I moved to San Francsisco proper and adopted my new 
								favorite doggo, Kirby, an aussie shepard mix that joins me on adventures through the city! Outside of work I 
								have a passion for musical theater, craft cocktails, gardening, board and video games, puzzle hunts	and escape
								rooms.
