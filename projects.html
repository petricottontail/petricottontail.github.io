								2017-2021 -- Fidget Ball for ADHD Intervention
							</h3>
							<img class="left" src="images/FidgetBall.jpg" width="180" height="180" alt="" />
							<p>
								Fidgeting is a natural phenomenon but fidgeting under observation is not. This long running 
								project was developed out of work first started at NYU by Kathine Isbister. We started on a
								suite of tools to allow tracing and interpreting fidgeting behavior in the wild through soft
								objects with embedded sensors. We use a mixture of custom made and market ready sensors in 
								deformable bodies for more comfortable usage by participants in the wild and in controlled 
								laboratory settings. This data can then be interpreted by therapists, researchers or doctors
								depending on the usage. I acted as the hardware and software lead for the project, developing
								connections	between microcontrollers and sensors. 
							</p>
							<p>		
								Our partnership with both a machine learning researcher to help interpret the large-scale data
								set and the MIND institue at UC Davis allowed us to structure our device apporiately so that 
								eventually we'd be able to interpret the data in real-time, and provide prompts to users when
								their absent minded fidgeting had progressed from helpful regulation to distraction. The project
								is currently under an NIH grant and is in full scale clinical trial to test efficacy.

								2017-2020 -- Soft-bodied Worry Pet for Structured Self-Soothing in Children
							</h3>
							<img class="right" src="images/WorryPet.jpg" width="370" height="180" alt="" />
							<p>
								Helping to intervene in the anxiety cycle can help young children learn to self-regulate
								but trying to find the right device and time to intervene can be difficult. Developed in parallel
								to the fidgeting device and with similar methods with different aims. We used a mixture of custom
								made and market ready sensors in deformable bodies. These embedded sensors help therapists determine
								interaction time and frequency in the wild and can help strucure future discussions. 
							</p>
							<p>			
								I acted as the hardware and software lead for the project, developing communications between 
								microcontrollers and sensors. For published information on initial results from the project see the
								publications below, the ToCHI article is the most complete account of the project development. 
							</p>
							<p>		
								These articles follow the multidisiplinary team from early development of potential designs and
								smart material investigations through the hand off to commercial production with Sproutel.
								I worked as the legacy researcher for 4 years helping to keep a throughline on the product while
								it was at UCSC and during the hand-off to the commercial team. I worked machine learning experts
								to attempt to process the data on a larger scale and develop wider trends from across the population.
								I also supported the user studies and performed data analysis after our team of child psycologists
								depolyed the device in the wild to investigate the effect on the target population. 
							</p>
							<p>		
								The commerical product <a href="https://purrble.com/">Purrble</a> has been highlighted in Time Magazine's
								"Best Inventions of 2021", and featured on QVC.

								2015-2017 -- Soft-Robot Gloves for Stroke Survivors Fine Motor Skill Rehabilitation 
							</h3>
							<img class="left" src="images/InnerGlove.jpg" width="160" height="160" alt="Inverted eletroic glove" />
							<p>
								An ongoing issue that stroke survivors face years after their incident are tremors. After performing
								expert interviews with physical therapists and recovery patients alike they mentioned this as a 
								primary annoyance. 
							</p>
							<p>		
								In an attempt to counteract tremors in patient's hands we used piezoresistive plastics along the
								length of the fingers to help strech, resist and counter to the user's tremor. After initial
								prototypes were developed and similar technology was being developed concurrently at MIT, we
								decided to pivot to alternative therapies for stroke rehabilitation.
							</p>
							<p>		
								While the work remains unpublished, we pivoted to developing an at-home daily exercise device for
								early non-invasive intervention for stroke survivors.

								2012-2013 -- Live-in ASSistant for Independence and Elder-care (LASSIE)
							</h3>
							<img class="right" src="images/LASSIE.jpg" width="240" height="300" alt="" />
							<p>
								LASSIE was a tele-operated robot with capabilities for vital sign detection I helped develop as
								part of my undergraduate thesis project, under the guidance of a graduate student Sebastian Hening.
							</p>
							<p>
								This robot was designed with older people living alone in mind to help determine the condition
								of the user and what level of emergency services were needed if any after a fall was detected.
								I helped retool an FFT algorithm to read heart and breath rates from a low-cost web camera, and
								extrapolate if these rates were outside of a normal range. I ended my undergraduate career with 
								decent success on the LASSIE robot; we found that our modified algorithm was able to detect a 
								heart rate with a 70% success rate. I also was awarded 1st place in “IT for Society” division
								of Big Ideas@Berkley competition for the LASSIE project, I Received Dean’s and Chancellor's Award 
								for Outstanding Undergraduate Research. I also had the opportunity to present our findings at the
								PETRA 2013 conference in Greece.

								Additional Research and Internships

							<h4 align="left" class="style20">
								Companion Labs Internship - Spring 2020
							</h4>								
							<p>
								Right as the Covid-19 pandemic arrived in the US in March of 2020, I began helping to Beta test
								the <a href="https://joincompanion.com/">Companion</a> dog training device, advising on how pet parents were interacting with the device at home
								and what information they required to properly interface with the device for effective dog training.
							</p>
							<p>		
								The intership allowed me to interact with several investors and personally introduce them to the AI 
								driven pet training device to entice them to invest in the next stage of depolyment as the company
								pivoted from in-shelter deployment to at-home devices.
							</p>
							<h4 align="left" class="style20">
								Blind Formatting Tool - 2014
							</h4>	
							<p>
								My work also included devloping the website and pet-parent facing advice pages.
							</p>
							<p>
								While not my project directly I helped in the documentation of a tool for blind users to format their
								documents that my labmate developed.

								Toyota ITC Internship - Spring 2014
							</h4>	
							<p>
								During the spring of 2014, I spent 3 months conducting interviews and performing paper reviews
								at Toyota ITC, investigating the use of Robotics in the world of Health Care and how we might improve
								robot to human hand-over techniques in hospice settings.
